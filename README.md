HI! This is a simple two player python game built using the PyGame library.
The game is styled around a pong like structure, except both characters are free
to move in any direction in their respective boundaries. After each character
loses a life, they will lose a heart in the health meter and their positions will
be reset to the starting spot. There are sound effects and background music implemented
into the game. Hope you try it out!



HOW TO PLAY:

Player 1 - W to move up, A to move left, S to move down,
D to move right, F to fire

Player 2 - Up arrow to move up, Left Arrow to move left,
Right Arrow to move right, Down Arrow to move down, Right Alt to fire
